= Percona XtraDB cluster with ProxySQL

A tool for testing XtraDB cluster with ProxySQL in front.

== Requirements

- JDK 17+
- Docker

== How it works

It is a simple Quarkus command-line application which creates and configures containers with https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers].

Testcontainers provides an easy-to-use API to manager containers and cleans everything up automatically when the JVM process stops.

== Building and running uber-jar

----
./mvnw
java -jar target/pxc-with-proxysql-runner.jar
----

== Building and installing uber-jar and startup-script in `PATH`

By default, the app is installed in `${HOME}/bin`.
Otherwise, set the `destDir` system property.

----
./mvnw -DputInPath -DdestDir="${HOME}/bin"
----

And then from any directory:

----
pxc-with-proxysql
----

Output looks like:
